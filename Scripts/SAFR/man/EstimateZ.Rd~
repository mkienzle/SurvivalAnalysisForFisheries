\title{Estimate total mortality (Z) using catch at age from a single cohort}
\description{
  This function provide an estimate of total mortality (Z) by maximum
  likelihood using a vector of catch at age from a cohort for each age
  group from 0 to max.age}
\usage{EstimateZ(catch)}
\arguments{
  \item{catch}{is a vector of numerics describing the number of fish
    caught in each yearly age-group. The first value reprensent fishes
 caught}
}

\examples{
# Suppose age varies between 0 and 10
age <- seq(0,10)

# Suppose you have a M=0.105, F and N0 are arbitrary (randomly generated)
M <- 0.105
F <- runif(1, min = 0.1, max = 3)
print(paste("Simulated Z is", round(M+F,3)))

# Generate a random recruitment
N0 <- runif(1, min = 1e3, max = 1e4)
print(paste("Simulated recruitment", round(N0)))

# Calculate number at age using a simple exponential model ( see Quinn and Deriso, 1999)
nb.at.age <- cbind(age, N0 * exp(-(M+ F)) ^ age)

# Calculate the total number of individual dying at age
total.death <- N0 * (exp(-(M+F) * age) - exp(-(M+F) * (age+1)))

# And the fraction dying from fishing 
catch <- F/(M+F) * total.death

# Estimate Z
best.Z.est <- EstimateZ(catch)
