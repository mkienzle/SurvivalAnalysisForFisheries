\section{Why are we doing this work ? why is this topic important ? Think about the key question you and your audience might have}

\begin{itemize}
\item The purpose of stock assessment is to estimate mortality rates
\item we love the likelihood approach because we can compare several point of view
\item Likelihood approach induces to look at problems from a statistical perspective
\item the Baranov model and its statistical counterpart
\item Survival analysis was develop with the same purpose in medical research

\item Here we propose an application of survival analysis to the analyse of catch at age
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item Likelihood of catch at age
\item Ability to estimate parameter from data matrices with $n < p$

\section{Detailed content of the article}


\noindent{\bf 1. Introduction}
\begin{itemize}

\item (CITE) used a statistical approach to catch at age analysis assuming these data were distributed according to a multinomial distribution. While this model recognise the presence of multiple age-groups in the data, it fails to account for properties associated with the Baranov equation such as for example that the proportion of individual surviving through time is a declining function of time.
\item Multinomial model
\item Baranov model

\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf 2. Materials and methods}\\

\noindent {\it 2.1 Likelihood method}
\begin{itemize}
\item very simple case on a single cohort
\item estimating M, q and selectivity on a single cohort
\item Multiple cohorts and the separability hypothesis
\item Estimator of recruitment
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\it 2.2 Simulations testing}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The datasets
\item Data uncertainty
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\it 2.3 Application to a case-study}\\
