Natural mortality estimates were biased using a fixed number of sample per years while it was when the number at age in the sample were weighted by total catch (Fig~\ref{fig:Estimating-NaturalMortality}). This correction to the sample data reduced considerably the uncertainty on natural mortality and remove almost completely bias because a small of amount was still present at the extremity of the range of natural mortality (0.1--1.0) tested. Increasing number of sample reduced uncertainty. \\ 

Estimates of catchability were much more consistent across the range of value (1--10 10$^{-4}$) tested between methods (Fig.~\ref{fig:Estimating-Catchability}). The bias of the un-weighted approach was often similar to that of the weighted one. But uncertainty associated with the former were much larger than the latter. They appeared to be fairly in-sensitive to sample size.
