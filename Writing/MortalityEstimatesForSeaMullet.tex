Sea mullet catchability was estimated to be equal to 7.068 $\pm$ 3.674 per boat-day (Tab.~\ref{tab:Sensitivity-CatchabilityToMulletDataTruncation}). Sensitivity analysis suggested this estimation was robust to data truncations, with catchability estimated to vary between [6.906; 7.142] with an average of 7.041 boat-day$^{-1}$.\\


Natural mortality for sea mullet was estimated to 0.328 $\pm$ 0.187 year$^{-1}$ using the entire dataset (comprising 2013 and 16 age-groups, Tab.~\ref{tab:Sensitivity-NaturalMortalityToMulletDataTruncation}). The sensitivity analysis to data truncation showed the method is robust to addition/delition of data with estimates varying between [0.292; 0.384] with an average 0.325 year$^{-1}$. \\%Uncertainties associated with natural mortalities were more variable than point estimates and tended to decrease with increasing number of years included into the analysis. On the other-hand they tended to increase with inclusion of greater number of age-groups with sporadic observations, although this trend was not as clear as the previous. \\
