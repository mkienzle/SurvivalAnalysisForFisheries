The straddling sea mullet ({\it Mugil cephalus}) population stretches along the east coast of Australia, with most landings occurring between 19$^{o}$S (approx. Townsville) and 37$^{o}$S (roughly the border between New South Wales and Victoria, \cite{Bell2005r}). The method was applied to age distributions of samples from Queensland's commercial catch obtained by otolithometry (Tab.~\ref{tab:Mullet-NbAtAge}). Starting in 2007, the sampling design was modified to include samples from both estuarine and ocean habitats to provide representative demographic statistics of the Queensland fishery. These data were analyzed to estimate natural mortality, catchability and gear selectivity.\\

This dataset, a matrix containing 7 years and 16 age-groups, was truncated in 2 ways to assess the robustness of the method to varying numbers of data. The first truncation removed the last and last-two years of data to evaluate the sensitivity of parameters estimates to addition/omission data in order to anticipate possible effects of future addition of data. The second truncation removed older age-groups from 10--11 to 15--16 to evaluate the importance of few old fish on natural mortality estimates as one could think {\it a priori} that these longer-lived individuals provided a lot of information on mortality.\\


%% Our mullet analysis is not based on an ALK, rather we age a known proportion of each catch we sample (we call it direct ageing). We also sample pretty much in proportion to the catch i.e. get most of the data from the areas of high catch. Which is why I was wondering if there was a different result. As you suggest I will soon be able to test it myself. By the sound of it the variances are a bit large when you use the unscaled data? Due to the sample size?
 
%% The age data is from the area we monitor, which is south of about Bundaberg. This constitutes much of the commercial Mullet fishery in QLD. There is also some data which suggests that Mullet north of here may be of a different genetic stock (Fraser Island being a barrier to larval dispersion). The same work also suggested only short to medium migrations (~150kms) along the coast. I think this is why the method works, we have a very good idea about the numbers of fish at age from our sampling, which access most of the fishery for this particular stock (in QLD at least). We should not forget there is a significant fishery for these beasties in NSW, but given the shortish migrations maybe much of the fish from their nursery areas/estuaries do not contribute significantly to the QLD fishery. NSW also have long term catch and effort data, as well as age distributions.‚Äù
