OPTabstract ={Motivation: Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm.Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution.Availability: The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is GPL licensed.

OPTabstract="Fisheries management agencies around the world collect age data for the purpose of assessing the status of natural resources in their jurisdiction. Estimates of mortality rates represent a key information to assess the sustainability of fish stocks exploitation. Contrary to medical research or manufacturing where survival analysis is routinely applied to estimate failure rates, survival analysis has seldom been applied in fisheries stock assessment despite similar purposes between these fields of applied statistics. In this paper, we developed hazard functions to model the dynamic of an exploited fish population. These functions were used to estimate all parameters necessary for stock assessment (including natural and fishing mortality rates as well as gear selectivity) by maximum likelihood using age data from a sample of catch. This novel application of survival analysis to fisheries stock assessment was tested by Monte Carlo simulations to assert that it provided unbiased estimations of relevant quantities. The method was applied to the data from the Queensland (Australia) sea mullet (Mugil cephalus) commercial fishery collected between 2007 and 2014. It provided, for the first time, an estimate of natural mortality affecting this stock: $0.22 \pm 0.08$ year $^{-1}$"

OPTabstract = "Abstract The cover of seagrasses and macroalgae, landings and fishery-independent measures of spawning stock and recruitment for brown tiger prawns, were monitored immediately following a major cyclone in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia in March 1999. Anecdotal evidence on the extent of seagrass from 1990 to 1998 suggests that the cyclone caused a major, immediate disruption and loss of the seagrass/macroalgal beds (to ≤2\% cover), the critical prawn nursery habitat, and mangroves in the shallow inshore waters of the system. Prawn landings and recruitment to the fishery were not affected in the year of the cyclone, but were markedly lower in the two years immediately afterwards and then increased as the cover of macrophytes increased to over 40\% in 2003. Tiger prawn landings and catch rates were not affected in Shark Bay, a system 500 km south of Exmouth Gulf that did not experience cyclonic disturbance. Seagrasses in Exmouth Gulf showed a succession of species from small colonising species (Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis) to larger, broad-leaved species (Cymodocea serrulata, Syringodium isoetifolium) only two years after the cyclone. The recruitment and landings of tiger prawns were correlated significantly with the total cover of macroalgae and seagrass. The large loss of seagrass and macroalgae reduced the settling habitat for postlarvae and the nursery habitat for juvenile tiger prawns, probably leading to the lower recruitment to the fishery. These findings suggest that the extent of seagrass and macroalgae are some of the factors defining the productivity of the tiger prawn fishery in Exmouth Gulf. "

Values of L∞(LT, cm), W∞(g, fresh weight), K (1/year) and T (°C, mean annual water temperature) were attributed to each value of M, and the 175 sets of values plotted such that:1) log M = −0·2107 − 0·0824 log W ∞ + 0·6757 log K + 0·4627 log T
and
2) log M = −0·0066 − 0·279 log L ∞ + 0·6543 log K + 0·4634 log TThe multiple correlation coefficients are for 1) 0·845, and for 2) 0·847, while the critical value (171 d.f.) is 0·275 (for P = 0·01). All slopes are significantly ≠ 0 (for P = 0·001). The standard deviation of estimates of log M are for 1) 0·247, and for 2) 0·245.The equations provide highly reliable estimates of M for any given fish stock, given the values of W ∞ or L ∞ and K of the von Bertalanffy growth formula, and an estimate of the mean water temperature in which the stock in question lives.Only two groups have values of M generally differing from those obtained through the proposed equations: the Clupeidae, with generally lower and the polar fishes with generally higher values. Correction factors are given for both groups. Potential applications of the findings to population dynamics are discussed together with some ecological implications.},

	OPTabstract = {<p align=justify>In this work, a new  stock assessment method, Direct Survival Analysis, is proposed and described. The  parameter estimation of the Weibull survival model proposed by Ferrandis (2007)  is obtained using trawl survey data. This estimation is used to establish a  baseline survival function, which is in turn used to estimate the specific  survival functions in the different cohorts considered through an adaptation of  the separable model of the fishing mortality rates introduced by Pope and  Shepherd (1982). It is thus possible to test hypotheses on the evolution of  survival during the period studied and to identify trends in recruitment. A  link is established between the preceding analysis of trawl survey data and the  commercial catch-at-age data that are generally obtained to evaluate the  population using analytical models. The estimated baseline survival, with the  proposed versions of the stock and catch equations and the adaptation of the  Separable Model, may be applied to commercial catch-at-age data. This makes it  possible to estimate the survival corresponding to the landing data, the  initial size of the cohort and finally, an effective age of first capture, in  order to complete the parameter model estimation and consequently the  estimation of the whole survival and mortality, along with the reference  parameters that are useful for management purposes. Alternatively, this  estimation of an effective age of first capture may be obtained by adapting the  demographic structure of trawl survey data to that of the commercial fleet  through suitable selectivity models of the commercial gears. The complete model  provides the evaluation of the stock at any age. The coherence (and hence the  mutual “calibration”) between the two kinds of information may be analysed and  compared with results obtained by other methods, such as virtual population  analysis (VPA), in order to improve the diagnosis of the state of exploitation  of the population. The model may be drawn up in a deterministic format, but the  main concepts may be interpreted as expectations if stock and catch are  considered as stochastic processes.  </p>},

OPTabstract = {Marine fisheries management strives to maintain sustainable populations while allowing exploitation. However, well-intentioned management plans may not meet this balance as most do not include the effect of climate change. Ocean temperatures are expected to increase through the 21st century, which will have far-reaching and complex impacts on marine fisheries. To begin to quantify these impacts for one coastal fishery along the east coast of the United States, we develop a coupled climate�population model for Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The model is based on a mechanistic hypothesis: recruitment is determined by temperature-driven, overwinter mortality of juveniles in their estuarine habitats. Temperature forecasts were obtained from 14 general circulation models simulating three CO 2 emission scenarios. An ensemble-based approach was used in which a multimodel average was calculated for a given CO 2 emission scenario to forecast the response of the population. The coupled model indicates that both exploitation and climate change significantly affect abundance and distribution of Atlantic croaker. At current levels of fishing, the average (2010�2100) spawning biomass of the population is forecast to increase by 60--100\%. Similarly, the center of the population is forecast to shift 50�100 km northward. A yield analysis, which is used to calculate benchmarks for fishery management, indicates that the maximum sustainable yield will increase by 30--100\%. Our results demonstrate that climate effects on fisheries must be identified, understood, and incorporated into the scientific advice provided to managers if sustainable exploitation is to be achieved in a changing climate.},

Juvenile P. esculentus (10–12 mm carapace length, CL) were examined at combinations of five temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 or 35°C) and six salinities (5, 15, 25, 35, 45 or 55%.) over 50 days. Individual prawns were identified by uropod clips and their carapace moult increment (MI) and intermoult period (IP) histories were obtained from exuviae. After 50 days, the prawns had survived a wide range of temperature-salinity combinations. Survival was greater than 60% in waters 15 to 30°C and 15 to 45%.; and at 35°C between 25 and 45%. Combinations of extreme temperatures and salinities were lethal. Moult increment varied little between 20 and 35°C or with prawn size. By contrast, \{IP\} increased markedly with decreasing temperature and to a lesser extent with prawn size and thus controlled growth rates. Fastest growth is estimated to be at 30°C and 30%. The condition of prawns, in terms of energy (21.0 to 22.8 kJ·g−1 ash free dry weight) and wet weight (WW) and dry weight (DW) to \{CL\} relationships varied little between treatments. The P. esculentus juveniles in this study, obtained from near the southern limit of the species distribution, coped in temperatures and salinities that were well outside those which they would normally encounter in the wild. Cool water is the major factor which restricts their distribution to tropical and subtropical Australia. Because P. esculentus is a potential aquaculture species, the implications of the above results for the culture of the species are discussed. "

Maunder, M. N., and Piner, K. R. Contemporary fisheries stock assessment: many issues still remain. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsu015.
Interpretation of data used in fisheries assessment and management requires knowledge of population (e.g. growth, natural mortality, and recruitment), fisheries (e.g. selectivity), and sampling processes. Without this knowledge, assumptions need to be made, either implicitly or explicitly based on the methods used. Incorrect assumptions can have a substantial impact on stock assessment results and management advice. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding of these processes for most, if not all, stocks and even for processes that have traditionally been assumed to be well understood (e.g. growth and selectivity). We use information content of typical fisheries data that is informative about absolute abundance to illustrate some of the main issues in fisheries stock assessment. We concentrate on information about absolute abundance from indices of relative abundance combined with catch, and age and length-composition data and how the information depends on knowledge of population, fishing, and sampling processes. We also illustrate two recently developed diagnostic methods that can be used to evaluate the absolute abundance information content of the data. Finally, we discuss some of the reasons for the slowness of progress in fisheries stock assessment.},

OPTabstract = {Abstract Though it is by far the most commonly used likelihood for composition data (proportions at length or age) in fisheries stock assessment models, the multinomial is poorly suited for this task. It has two salient weaknesses: it can not replicate the correlations found in these data; and it is not self-weighting (i.e., the parameters that weight the composition data can not be estimated inside the model). This latter weakness derives from the fact that the multinomial likelihood, being designed for discrete data but used for continuous data, is improper (i.e., its integral over all permissible data values is not constant). All other likelihoods commonly used for composition data share at least one of these weaknesses but there is one – the logistic-normal – which can be extended to avoid both. Some, like the multivariate normal, are misused because their structure ignores the defining properties of composition data: that they lie between 0 and 1, and sum to 1. A collection of 72 composition data sets from 28 stock assessments originating from nine different computer programs was used to evaluate the extended logistic-normal, together with the Dirichlet likelihood, which is self-weighting but does not allow positive correlations (and so may be useful for composition data with small correlations). The logistic-normal appears very promising, especially for unsexed length compositions. The next step in evaluating the extended logistic-normal likelihood will be to code it into stock assessment programs, and some of the technical problems associated with this step are discussed. }

Infections apparently originate when fish are juveniles in fresh water. The abundance of the parasite in \{SE\} Queensland and the absence of the parasite from mullet further south indicates that the wave of fish that appears to move up the coast in the autumn may be an illusion. The parasite data suggest that large numbers of fish are not moving from northern \{NSW\} into \{SE\} Queensland.

Biomass, catchability, and natural mortality are key parameters in fish stock assessment. Yet, it is difficult to estimate these quantities, especially natural mortality, when only fishery data are available. Using a method of population depletion analysis, we estimated these population and biological quantities for the white banana prawn (Penaeus merguiensis) in Australia's valuable Northern Prawn Fishery. In addition, we directly included fishing power change over time. The models were implemented in a Bayesian framework by incorporating process error, observation error, and random variability for the underlying parameters. The posterior median initial fishable biomass ranged from ∼2000 to 7000 t year−1, and the median catchability varied from ∼3.8 × 10−4 to 7.3 × 10−4 boat-day−1, resulting in an average fishing power increase of 2.6% per year. An unexpected result is the estimate of exponential natural mortality rate of ∼0.03 week−1. This value is substantially lower than an earlier estimate of 0.05 week−1, which was based on a single year's fishery data in one stock region and has been widely used for over four decades without validation. We attribute this low natural mortality estimate mainly to prawn aggregation behaviour.},

OPTabstract = "An enhanced version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model \{SEAPODYM\} is presented to describe spatial dynamics of tuna and tuna-like species in the Pacific Ocean at monthly resolution over 1° grid-boxes. The simulations are driven by a bio-physical environment predicted from a coupled ocean physical–biogeochemical model. This new version of \{SEAPODYM\} includes expanded definitions of habitat indices, movements, and natural mortality based on empirical evidences. A thermal habitat of tuna species is derived from an individual heat budget model. The feeding habitat is computed according to the accessibility of tuna predator cohorts to different vertically migrating and non-migrating micronekton (mid-trophic) functional groups. The spawning habitat is based on temperature and the coincidence of spawning fish with presence or absence of predators and food for larvae. The successful larval recruitment is linked to spawning stock biomass. Larvae drift with currents, while immature and adult tuna can move of their own volition, in addition to being advected by currents. A food requirement index is computed to adjust locally the natural mortality of cohorts based on food demand and accessibility to available forage components. Together these mechanisms induce bottom-up and top-down effects, and intra- (i.e. between cohorts) and inter-species interactions. The model is now fully operational for running multi-species, multi-fisheries simulations, and the structure of the model allows a validation from multiple data sources. An application with two tuna species showing different biological characteristics, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus), is presented to illustrate the capacity of the model to capture many important features of spatial dynamics of these two different tuna species in the Pacific Ocean. The actual validation is presented in a companion paper describing the approach to have a rigorous mathematical parameter optimization [Senina, I., Sibert, J., Lehodey, P., 2008. Parameter estimation for basin-scale ecosystem-linked population models of large pelagic predators: application to skipjack tuna. Progress in Oceanography]. Once this evaluation and parameterization is complete, it may be possible to use the model for management of tuna stocks in the context of climate and ecosystem variability, and to investigate potential changes due to anthropogenic activities including global warming and fisheries pressures and management scenarios.

OPTabstract={Fish population variability and fisheries activities are closely linked to weather and climate dynamics. While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of "unexpected" events-that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic-on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans' ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dynamics of fish species at daily, decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relationships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics. It is concluded with recommendations for collaborative work between climatologists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists to resolve some of the outstanding problems in the development of sustainable fisheries.

Ancillary variables in such relationships, with a priori justification for being chosen, could be parameters describing the state of the fish stock in question or the state of its biological or physical environment. Long time-series of biological data exist for several stocks, and these data series should be used for testing proposed relationships.

@article{Maunder201361,
    OPTabstract = {Limited data, and the requirement to provide science-based advice for exploited populations, have led to the development of statistical methods that combine several sources of information into a single analysis. This approach,  ” integrated analysis”, was first formulated by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Contemporary use of integrated analysis involves using all available data, in as raw a form as appropriate, in a single analysis. Analyses that were traditionally carried out independently are now conducted simultaneously through likelihood functions that include multiple data sources. For example, the traditional analysis of converting catch-at-length data into catch-at-age data for use in an age-structured population dynamics models can be avoided by including the basic data used in this conversion, length-frequency and conditional age-at-length data, in the likelihood function. This allows for consistency in assumptions and permits the uncertainty associated with both data sources to be propagated to final model outputs, such as catch limits under harvest control rules. The development of the \\{AD\\} Model Builder software has greatly facilitated the use of integrated analyses, and there are now several general stock assessment models (e.g., Stock Synthesis) that allow many data types and model assumptions to be analyzed simultaneously. In this paper, we define integrated analysis, describe its history and development, give several examples, and describe the advantages of and problems with integrated analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The genome of the domestic cow, Bos taurus, was sequenced using a mixture of hierarchical and whole-genome shotgun sequencing methods.RESULTS:We have assembled the 35 million sequence reads and applied a variety of assembly improvement techniques, creating an assembly of 2.86 billion base pairs that has multiple improvements over previous assemblies: it is more complete, covering more of the genome; thousands of gaps have been closed; many erroneous inversions, deletions, and translocations have been corrected; and thousands of single-nucleotide errors have been corrected. Our evaluation using independent metrics demonstrates that the resulting assembly is substantially more accurate and complete than alternative versions.CONCLUSIONS:By using independent mapping data and conserved synteny between the cow and human genomes, we were able to construct an assembly with excellent large-scale contiguity in which a large majority (approximately 91\%) of the genome has been placed onto the 30 B. taurus chromosomes. We constructed a new cow-human synteny map that expands upon previous maps. We also identified for the first time a portion of the B. taurus Y chromosome.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:We present the genome sequence of the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, which is a member of the kangaroo family and the first representative of the iconic hopping mammals that symbolize Australia to be sequenced. The tammar has many unusual biological characteristics, including the longest period of embryonic diapause of any mammal, extremely synchronized seasonal breeding and prolonged and sophisticated lactation within a well-defined pouch. Like other marsupials, it gives birth to highly altricial young, and has a small number of very large chromosomes, making it a valuable model for genomics, reproduction and {development.RESULTS}:The genome has been sequenced to 2 x coverage using Sanger sequencing, enhanced with additional next generation sequencing and the integration of extensive physical and linkage maps to build the genome assembly. We also sequenced the tammar transcriptome across many tissues and developmental time points. Our analyses of these data shed light on mammalian reproduction, development and genome evolution: there is innovation in reproductive and lactational genes, rapid evolution of germ cell genes, and incomplete, locus-specific X inactivation. We also observe novel retrotransposons and a highly rearranged major histocompatibility complex, with many class I genes located outside the complex. Novel {microRNAs} in the tammar {HOX} clusters uncover new potential mammalian {HOX} regulatory {elements.CONCLUSIONS}:Analyses of these resources enhance our understanding of marsupial gene evolution, identify marsupial-specific conserved non-coding elements and critical genes across a range of biological systems, including reproduction, development and immunity, and provide new insight into marsupial and mammalian biology and genome evolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {Open Source Software is one of the most striking innovations in
    software development in the 1990s. It has been stimulated by the
    success of LINUX and the Internet which facilitated global
    communication as well as data and software exchange. The
    Geographical Information System GRASS (Geographical
    Resources Analysis Support System) is the largest Free Software
    GIS Project and by the size of the code it belongs to the top ten list
    of all Open Source Projects worldwide. 
    Open Source GIS: A GRASS GIS Approach was written for
    experienced GIS users, who want to learn GRASS, as well as for the
    Open Source software users who are GIS newcomers. 
    Following the Open Source model of GRASS, the book includes
    links to sites where the GRASS system and on-line reference
    manuals can be downloaded and additional applications can be
    viewed. The project's web site can be reached at http://grass.itc.it
    and a number of mirror sites worldwide. 
    Open Source GIS: A GRASS GIS Approach, provides basic
    information about the use of GRASS from setting up the spatial
    database, through working with raster, vector and site data, to image
    processing and hands-on applications. This book also contains a
    brief introduction to programming within GRASS encouraging the
    new GRASS development. The power of computing within Open
    Source environment is illustrated by examples of the GRASS usage
    with other Open Source software tools, such as GSTAT, R
    statistical language, and linking GRASS to MapServer. 
    Open Source GIS: A GRASS GIS Approach is designed to meet
    the needs of a professional audience composed of researchers and
    practitioners in industry and graduate level students in Computer
    Science and Geosciences.}
