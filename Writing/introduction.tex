One of the purposes of stock assessment is to estimate mortalities affecting fish stocks. The central mortality model used in fisheries research was proposed by Baranov \citep{quin99b} to describe the variation of the number of fish belonging to a cohort through time. This deterministic exponential model has a statistical counterpart in the form of the exponential probability distribution function \citep{cow98b}. Adoptiong a statistical view of this problem allows to develop maximum likelihood estimators \citep{Burnb03} of parameters of importance to stock assessment. The branch of statistics focused on survival analysis has extended and refined methods to estimate mortality rates \citep{cox84b}. This document describes an application of survival analysis to fisheries catch at age data.
