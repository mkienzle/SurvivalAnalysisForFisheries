Sand whiting  ({\it Sillago ciliata}, Cuvier 1829) is primarily estuarine and near shore species harvested by both commercial and recreational fishing sectors\citep{JAI:JAI12478}. In Queensland, the majority of the commercial catch come from bays: Hervey Bay accounted for 47\% of total catch since 1988 and Moreton Bay accounted for 37\% (Fig.~\ref{fig:CatchPropertionPerRegion}). Available data indicated that sand whiting were mostly caught using gillnets until the late 1990s but later ring netting became dominant in Hervey Bay. While tunnel netting became the prefered fishing method for sand whiting in Moreon Bay (Fig.~\ref{fig:TotalCatch-byYear-HerveyAndMoretonBay}). Total catches have been fairly constant since 1988 with a mean catch around 130 $\pm$ 33 tonnes in Hervey Bay and 100 $\pm$ 27 tonnes in Moreton Bay. Catches have been slightly declining in recent years in both regions. \\

Commercial catch and CPUE show a strong seasonal variation peaking in winter --> is this related to spawning aggregation which increase catchability ?
