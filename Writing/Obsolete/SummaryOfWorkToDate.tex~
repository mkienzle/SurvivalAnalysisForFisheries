\begin{itemize}
\item age structure stock assessment model applies to catch at age data spanning a number of years larger than the number of age-groups (see \cite{mill99m, Four82a,CASAL12m} for examples).
\item LTMP catch at age data for sand whiting covers 7 years (2007--2013) and 13 age-groups (0--12): at least six more years of data collection are required until stock assessment methods found in the literature can be applied to them.
\item no framework was readily available to process these data in less than 20 days: substantially more time has to be allocated to this research topic to achieve the goals of LTMP.
\item a stock assessment that doesn't use age-data could be applied to catch and effort. Alternatively, an hybrid method, say a mixture of a delay difference and an age structure, might be develop for sand whiting to exploit age-data in conjunction with longer catch and effort time series. The time necessary to develop such non-standard method might well be in excess of 2 years of work.
