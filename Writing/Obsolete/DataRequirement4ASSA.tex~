Methods for stock assessments have been developed for a variety of data to estimate fishing mortality and the status of a fish population \citep{DowP2007}. Age-structured methods often require the number of years of age data collection to exceed the number of age-group existing in the population to allow for one or more cohorts to have gone entirely through the fishery (Tab.~\ref{tab:SAmethodRequirement}).\\

Most catch at age methods require an index of abundance. This index is understood as an independent measurement from commercial catch and effort data. In case fishery independent data are not available, researchers have used catch per unit of effort or standardised catch per unit of effort as an index of abundance (CITE).\\
