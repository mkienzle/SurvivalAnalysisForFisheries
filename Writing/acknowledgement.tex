I would like to thank the staff in the Long Term Monitoring Program of Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for their hard work collecting otoliths and measuring age. In particular, I am in debt to Jason McGilvray for introducing and explaining the intricacies of the mullet dataset to me. I am grateful to W.N. Venables from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and N. White from Queensland University of Technology for the many discussions on the topic of applying survival analysis to fisheries data.
